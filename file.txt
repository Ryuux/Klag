Hi, I'm Ryo, a young Chilean passionate about programming and technology in general. Since I was little I have been curious about the world of computing and I have decided to explore and learn as much as I can about it.

I love programming and have gained skills in different languages like JavaScript, Lua, Node.js and Python. I like to keep up with the latest trends and advances in the field of technology, as this allows me to always be at the forefront.

One of my passions is sharing my knowledge and interests with others, and that is why I have been present in different social networks such as ILoveRyuux. There, I have been able to meet other programmers and learn from them, which has allowed me to further improve my skills.

Although I don't have a job right now, I'm sure my passion for programming will lead me to great things in the future. I am a foodie and love to learn new things, which I think is a very valuable quality in any career.

I like to think about my future and the areas of programming in which I would like to specialize. There are many different areas that I can focus on, from artificial intelligence to web development, so it is important that I find something that I am passionate about and that allows me to develop my skills to the fullest.

My stage name, Ryo/Ryuux/ILoveRyuux, reflects my creativity and originality. It's important to have a stage name that reflects my personality and interests, and I'm very happy with the choice I made.

In short, I am very happy with everything I have achieved at my age. I am a talented, dedicated and enthusiastic person, and I am confident that I have a great future ahead of me. I will continue to pursue my dreams and I will never give up, because with my passion and my skills, I am sure that I will go far. Much success in everything you do, me!
